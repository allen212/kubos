Python
======

The Kubos SDK Vagrant box comes with a Python interperter and all the modules
needed to develop a basic hardware service. Services can be tested locally
in the Vagrant box up until the point that they need hardware interaction.

Flashing
--------

.. note::

   Python is currently only supported on the BeagleboneBlack and MBM2

There are currently two ways to add Python programs to Kubos Linux:

1. Fork and clone `kubos-linux-build <https://github.com/kubos/kubos-linux-build>`__
   and add additional Python packages to Buildroot. You can see our current system
   packages and how they are structured `here <https://github.com/kubos/kubos-linux-build/tree/master/package/python>`__.
   See the SysAdmin section :doc:`here <../os-docs>` for more information on
   building Kubos Linux.

2. Individual Python files can be flashed to an attached hardware target. The
   instructions are fairly similar to flashing a rust binary:

   1. Navigate to an existing example Kubos module like ``kubos-linux-example``.
   2. Run ``kubos linux -a``.
   3. Run ``kubos -t [target] build`` using the same target you cross-compiled with.
   4. Run ``kubos flash /absolute/path/to/python/file``. You must use the absolute
      path to the Python file you'd like to flash. Relative paths will not work.


Running on Target
-----------------

The following steps will allow you to run Python files which have been flashed
to a Linux target:

1. Run ``minicom kubos`` from inside of the Vagrant box.
2. Enter the username ``kubos`` and the password ``Kubos123``.
3. Navigate to the folder ``/home/system/usr/local/bin``.
4. This folder is the default destination for flashed files. Your
   Python files should be here. You can now run them with ``python file.py``.
