Example Kubos Projects
======================

We have provided a variety of example applications to help you get started with your Kubos project.
These examples are located in the 'Examples' folder of the `Kubos repo <http://github.com/kubos/kubos/tree/master/examples>`__, 
as well as within the `/home/vagrant/.kubos/kubos/examples` folder of the Kubos SDK box.

Using an Example Application
----------------------------

Each of the example applications contains the files necessary to run as an independent Kubos project. 
This means you can simply copy the desired example to a new folder and immediately build it with the ``kubos build`` command.

"Compatible Targets" indicates which target boards for which the application should execute successfully without modification.

.. note:: 

    The default target for all of these applications is ``stm32f407-disco-gcc``. 
    You will need to manually change the target if this is not your desired endpoint device. 

Default Example
---------------

`Example Code - GitHub <http://github.com/kubos/kubos/tree/master/examples/kubos-linux-example>`__

**Compatible Targets: All targets**

+----------------------+------------------------+
| High-level Component | Specific Area          |
+======================+========================+
| Kubos CSP [4]_       | sockets, ping, threads |
+----------------------+------------------------+

This is the default application included when the ``kubos init --linux`` command is executed.
It is intended as a basic example of how an application could be written to run on a Kubos Linux system.

The application contains a CSP interaction between client and server tasks.

Every 200ms, the CSP client thread pings the CSP server's address to see if it is available, and then connects and sends a CSP 
packet containing the message "Hello World".

The CSP server thread checks for connections on the CSP port and then prints any received messages to STDOUT.    

TCP Receive
-----------

`Example Code - GitHub <http://github.com/kubos/kubos/tree/master/examples/kubos-linux-tcprx>`__

**Compatible Targets: Pumpkin MBM2, Beaglebone Black**

+----------------------+--------------------+
| High-level Component | Specific Area      |
+======================+====================+
| Linux                | sockets, TCP, IPv4 |
+----------------------+--------------------+

This is a demo program to test receiving TCP data over a valid IP connection (the ethernet port for the Pumpkin MBM2 and Beaglebone 
Black targets)

The program will wait for a client to connect over the socket, then read in any messages and send back a reply.

TCP Send
--------

`Example Code - GitHub <http://github.com/kubos/kubos/tree/master/examples/kubos-linux-tcprx>`__

**Compatible Targets: Pumpkin MBM2, Beaglebone Black**

+----------------------+--------------------+
| High-level Component | Specific Area      |
+======================+====================+
| Linux                | sockets, TCP, IPv4 |
+----------------------+--------------------+

This is a demo program to test sending TCP data over a valid IP connection (the ethernet port for the Pumpkin MBM2 and Beaglebone Black 
targets)

The program takes the IP address and port to send to as input parameters, then sends a test message to the requested end point.
It then waits for a reply message to be returned and exits.

    Usage: kubos-linux-tcptx <ip_addr> <port>

UART Receive
------------

`Example Code - GitHub <http://github.com/kubos/kubos/tree/master/examples/kubos-linux-uartrx>`__

**Compatible Targets: All targets with UART ports**

+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| High-level Component | Specific Area                                                     |
+======================+===================================================================+
| Linux                | `termios <http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/termios.3.html>`__ |
+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+

This is a demo program to test receiving UART data in non-blocking mode as an interrupt. It expects to read the incrementing message 
"Test message nnn" every 5 seconds from `/dev/ttyS1`.

This program should be paired with the UART Send demo program.

UART Send
---------

`Example Code - GitHub <http://github.com/kubos/kubos/tree/master/examples/kubos-linux-uarttx>`__

**Compatible Targets: All targets with UART ports**

+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| High-level Component | Specific Area                                                     |
+======================+===================================================================+
| Linux                | `termios <http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/termios.3.html>`__ |
+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+

This is a demo program to test UART transmission. It will write an incrementing message "Test message nnn" every 5 seconds out of `/dev/ttyS3`.

This program should be paired with the UART Receive demo program.

ADC Thermistor
--------------

`Example Code - GitHub <http://github.com/kubos/kubos/tree/master/examples/adc-thermistor>`__

**Compatible Targets: All targets with ADC pins**

**Additional Hardware: Thermistor, 10 kOhm resistor**

+----------------------+---------------+
| High-level Component | Specific Area |
+======================+===============+
| Linux                | ADC (IIO)     |
+----------------------+---------------+

This is a demo program to test reading a raw value from an ADC pin.
It will use the raw value to derive a temperature reading from the connected thermistor.    

.. note::

    This example is configured for an ADC pin with a 10-bit resolution connected to a 10 kOhm
    thermistor with a 3.3V reference voltage and a voltage supply of 2.4V. These values might
    need to be changed based on your test setup
